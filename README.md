# HumanReadableCompressed
Python scripts for compressing and decompressing human-readable serialised files (JSON/JSONL/YAML/YML). Includes a GUI exe file for convenience<br><br>

To use just download the latest release and run the HrcGui exe or run the python scripts through a terminal.<br>
Usage should be pretty self explanitory<br><br>
I may release a version in the future that specifically supports adding it to PATH. Also, I might make a VSC extension that can read hrc files so they don't need to be decompressed <br><br>
